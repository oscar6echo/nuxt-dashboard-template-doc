# Scripts


The entry points to run commands to dev, buid or deploy the Nuxt app are:
- file [package.json](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/package.json) for Javascript scripts
- folder [python/scripts](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/tree/master/python/scripts) for Python scripts


## Javascript

The following commands can be run in the [nuxt-dashboard-template](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template) repo top folder.  
(where file [package.json](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/package.json) is)

In the scripts above `[f]` is either:
- `v` for **vuetify**
- `b` for **bootstrap**.  


## Python


The following commands are available from the [python/scripts](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/tree/master/python/scripts).

To run these scripts you must have installed the `build_frontend` Python package as described in the [Get Started section](../get-started/start).


- [analyze_dist.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/analyze_dist.py)  
  - Displays number of distinct files and content size for `.html` and `.js` files in folder `dist/`.
  - Essentially it enables to check that all `.html` files are identical and quickly view the name and sizes of the `.js` files.
- [build_single_file.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/build_single_file.py)  
  - Build a single `.html` file that contains the app entirely.
  - This script
    - copies files `Ã¬ndex.html`, `app.js`, `commons.app.js`, `runtime.js` from folder `dist/` and file `favicon.ico` from folder `static/` to folder `python/workspace/`.
    - merge all these files into a single file `index.html` saved in folder `python/template/`.
- [copy_cdn_static_to_dist.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/copy_cdn_static_to_dist.py)  
  - Copy all files in `cdn/` to `dist/`.
  - This is useful to make the dashboard *companion* files available in the case of the app is served from folder `dist/`.
- [select_framework_bootstrap.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/select_framework_bootstrap.py)  
  - Deletes folders `components/`, `layouts/`, `pages/` and replace them by the same named folders located in `python/framework/bootstrap/`.
- [select_framework_vuetify.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/select_framework_vuetify.py)  
  - Deletes folders `components/`, `layouts/`, `pages/` and replace them by the same named folders located in `python/framework/vuetify/`.
- [serve_dir_dist.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/serve_dir_dist.py)  
  - Start a web server (`python -m http.server`) from folder `dist/`.
  - This folder typically contains the product of `nuxt build` and a copy of the files in `cdn/`.
- [serve_dir_template.py](https://github.com/oscar6echo/nuxt-dashboard-template/blob/master/python/scripts/serve_dir_template.py)  
  - Start a web server (`python -m http.server`) from folder `python/template/`.
  - This folder should contain the product of `build_single_file.py` and a copy of the files in `cdn/`.
